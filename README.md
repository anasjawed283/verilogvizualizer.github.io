<!--------------------------------------->

☐ Version 1.0

☐ Build Date - October 2023

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

☐ 1.1	Purpose
> The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the software requirements for the "Verilog to State Diagram Converter Web Application." It outlines the scope of the project, its features, and the necessary constraints.

☐ 1.2	Scope
> This document covers the requirements for the development of a web application that converts Verilog code into state diagrams, visualizing the state machines within the code. It includes functional and non-functional aspects and specifies the intended audience and references for the project.

☐ 1.3	Document Conventions
>This document follows industry-standard document conventions and uses the IEEE 830-1998 template for software requirements specifications.


☐ 1.4	Intended Audience
>The intended audience for this document includes project stakeholders, the development team, quality assurance team, and any other parties involved in the project.

☐ 1.5	References
>IEEE Std 830-1998, "IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications."

<h2>2. Overall Description</h2>

☐ 2.1	Product Perspective
>The "Verilog to State Diagram Converter Web Application" is a standalone tool designed to convert Verilog code into visual state diagrams. It does not interact with other software systems.

☐ 2.2	Product Functions
>The primary functions of the application include Verilog parsing, state machine identification, graph representation, state diagram generation, interactive visualization, and the ability to display state details.


☐ 2.3	User Classes and Characteristics
>The users of this application include digital hardware designers and engineers. Users are expected to have a basic understanding of Verilog and state machines

☐ 2.4	Operating Environment
>The application will run as a web-based tool and is compatible with modern web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge).

☐ 2.5	Design and Implementation Constraints
>The application must be developed using web technologies, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness. It should handle Verilog code within defined size limits.

☐ 2.6	User Documentation
>User documentation will include a user manual with instructions on how to use the application, as well as explanations of the state diagrams.

☐ 2.7	Assumptions and Dependencies
>The application assumes that users will provide valid Verilog code.
